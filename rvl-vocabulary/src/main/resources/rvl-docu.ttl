A Property mapping (PM) defines the mapping from one source property (i.e., a relation) to one target graphic relation. Depending on the type of graphic relation different sub-types of PM have to be used. For graphic-object-to-object relations <a href=\"#http://purl.org/rvl/PropertyToGraphicObjToObjRelationMapping\">PropertyToGraphicObjToObjRelationMapping</a> and for graphic attributes <a href=\"#http://purl.org/rvl/PropertyToGraphicAttributeMapping\">PropertyToGraphicAttributeMapping</a>. The latter allows for various settings on the mapping of different values.

<h3>When are PM applied?</h3>
Property mappings apply, whenever a property instance (i.e. a statement using the property) exists, no matter what is the object or subject. When constraints need to be made on the application of the mapping, filters have to be used on subject and/or object.

The following figure illustrates a PM that is independent of the source values. Only the existence of some value for \"geo:coordinates\" leads to the creation of a world-shaped label:
<img src=\"http://www-st.inf.tu-dresden.de/semvis/ontologies/rvl/img/mapping_example_mapping_the_existence_of_properties.png\" style=\"width:100%\"/>

<h3>To which Graphic Object is a PM applied?</h3>
Settings defined by a mapping will by default be applied to the Graphic object (GO) representing the <b>subject</b> of the mapped statement. This means changes to graphic attributes are applied to the subject's GO and the subject's GO is chosen as the starting point for graphic object-to-object relations defined in the mapping. When new graphic objects are implicitly created by a mapping (e.g. as a label) they, too, will be assigned to the subject's GO. When this default behavior is not desired two options are at hand:
<ol>
     <li>Map the inverse property instead (e.g., \"updatedBy\" instead of \"updates\")</li>
     <li>Use a filter-expression to invert the direction of the statement (e.g., \"!updates\" instead of updates) . This will selected objects instead of the subjects.</li>
     <li>(only usable within sub-mappings:) Use the rvl:onRole parameter to define the graphic object to which the mapping is to be applied.</li>
</ol>

<h3>How to map multiple values for the same property?</h3>
This problem frequently occurs, for example, when mapping rdf:type, since multiple inheritance is allowed in RDFS. When multiple values for a source property exist and only one value is possible, the more specific value shall be processed. <i>For PropertyToGraphicAttributeMappings</i>, in case of two equally specific values, a warning shall be issued and the first value that is loaded shall be used. <i>For PropertyToGraphicObjToObjRelationMappings</i>, a warning shall be issued and the graphic object representing the subject shall be duplicated. """^^xsd:string ;
      <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#editorialNote>
              """EXISTENCE MAPPINGS:
As described, each property mapping is an \"existence mapping\", so no extra class is needed for this. A PM without filters does exactly the job, when exactly one target vaue is defined (this is inline with semantics of other settings). However, we could improve performance by explicitly stating, that the context (e.g. the value of the object) will not influence the mapping process. Any existence of the property will lead to the mapping described by the property mapping and no value mappings have to be considered (consider that value mappings are only special filters on the object side!!). We first considered to have a new class - Constant mapping - for this kind of property mapping.

NEW GO:
rvl:newGraphicObject could be used as a targetValue, when a new additional GO needs to be created. Whether this GO can also be a complex CGO having an internal structure (NV/PPR) and/or can have visual attributes already set from the beginning, or whether it should be the instance of a VR needs to be examined.

FILTERS: 
Besides the objectFilter and the subjectFilter, which are implemented, also an additional predicateFilter could be allowed (resp. we could allow a complex (SPARQL) selector as the range for sourceProperty). When we should introduce a predicateFilter, it has to be clarified whether it may be used in addition to the selection of a sourceProperty (only refining it) or instead of this setting. Since the defininition of property-paths and other complex relations may be achieved on the data side by introducing temporary properties and/or inference (e.g. for handling subproperties), no further filters are allowed for the moment. 

FILTERS - ONE FILTER FOR ALL:
Instead of separately describing the sourceProperty and various filters, also a complex statement-filter (e.g. a SPARQL selector) could be used to simply select all triples to be mapped. This, however, does not meet our goal of a stepwise and explicit definition of mappings. For example, this would cause problems when it comes to generating legends, since the sourceProperty is not explicitly defined. Having separate filters for subject, object and (possibly, for refinement) predicate, reduces the complexity of the single filter definitions and can more easily be handled.

FILTERS vs. sourceValue... properties:
While both objectFilter and properties such as sourceValue constrain the set of statements by the resources used as object in these statements, objectFilter is meant to filter via a complex (e.g. SPARQL) selector, while sourceValue defines single valid values. The properties sourceValueSet and sourceValueOrderedSet allow for easily selecting specific resources allowed as objects. SourceValueOrderedSet as well as the properties sourceValueUpper/LowerBound allow for defining ranges and existing sets of values in a more consise way. 

sourceValue... properties and object/subject:
All properties starting with sourceValue always refer to the object of the source statement that is to be mapped, not the subjects - just as valuemappings do. The object may be a literal or a complex resource on its own.  

MULTIPLE VALUES FOR THE SAME PROPERTY:
In future versions of RVL, also multiple values could be mapped and property could be introduced that allows for defining how to handle multiple values. Options could include: Use colored stripes, when mapping to multiple colors, mix colors (blue+yellow=green) or somehow calculate in-between values.

Value mappings (VM) define which source values should be mapped to which target values and optionally provide further information on how to do this mapping of values exactly. That way they are a supplement to Property-to-Graphic-Attribute Mappings (P2GAM), which only draw the general connection between the source relation and the target graphic relation. If no VM is defined for a P2GAM, a single default VM with default settings is used, which basically maps all the available source values to all the available target values.

<li>VMs can be seen as a shorthand for simple object filters on the object (value) side of a statement.</li>
<li>Each value mapping may have its own settings like discreteStepCount.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Selectors</h3>

<h4>Selecting Intervals (Ranges)</h4>
VMs may be constrained by creating an <a href=\"#http://purl.org/rvl/Interval\">Interval</a> of values defining a minimum and/or maximum value using <a href=\"#http://purl.org/rvl/sourceValueInterval\">sourceValueInterval</a>. The same can be done for graphic attributes using <a href=\"#http://purl.org/rvl/targetValueInterval\">targetValueInterval</a>.

<h4>Selecting Ordered Sets, Lists and Unordered Sets</h4>
(Existing) ordered sets of ordered source values can be selected using <a href=\"#http://purl.org/rvl/sourceValueOrderedSet\">sourceValueOrderedSet</a>. <br/> (Existing) unordered sets can be selected using <a href=\"#http://purl.org/rvl/sourceValueSet\">sourceValueSet</a> or simply by using <a href=\"#http://purl.org/rvl/sourceValue\">sourceValue</a> multiple times. All selected values will build an ad-hoc set. <br/>  For the target graphic attribute values the analogeous properties <a href=\"#http://purl.org/rvl/targetValueOrderedSet\">targetValueOrderedSet</a>, <a href=\"#http://purl.org/rvl/targetValueSet\">targetValueSet</a>, <a href=\"#http://purl.org/rvl/targetValueList\">targetValueList</a> and <a href=\"#http://purl.org/rvl/targetValueCycle\">targetValueCycle</a> can be used. Refer to the description of these properties on details on how they differ from each other.

<h4>Exclude single source or target values from the mapping</h4>
When some specific value shall not be handled by the VM, rather than defining a new set of all desired values, we can reuse an existing set or interval and exclude the value in question using <a href=\"#http://purl.org/rvl/excludeSourceValue\">excludeSourceValue</a> (resp. <a href=\"#http://purl.org/rvl/excludeTargetValue\">excludeTargetValue</a>).

<h4>Complex Source Value Selectors</h4>
More complex source value selectors can be defined using <a href=\"#http://purl.org/rvl/sourceFilter\">sourceFilter</a> which allows for SPARQL and FSL expressions.

<h4>Valid combinations of source/target selectors in a single VM:</h4>
In a single value mapping, most source selectors are to be used alternatively - only those selecting an (unordered) set of values can be used in combination and also multiple times. The union of all values selected by sourceValueSet and sourceValue will be used as source values. Further potential exceptions to this have not been specified by now for reasons of simplicity. (This applies equally to target selectors).

<h3>Additional mapping parameters</h3>
Value mappings can store additional information on the desired mapping process. For example the property <a href=\"#http://purl.org/rvl/discretize\">discretize</a> and <a href=\"#http://purl.org/rvl/discreteStepCount\">discreteStepCount</a> define if and how a discretization of values should be done. Via <a href=\"#http://purl.org/rvl/scaleTransformation\">scaleTransformation</a>, the scaling can be changed from linear scale transformation  (default) to a logarithmic one, for example.

<h3>Giving hints on the scale of measurement</h3>
By default, VMs are performed based on the scale of measurement that can be derived from the source and target properties as well as from the available values. An ordinal or quantitative scale of measurement may be explicitly stated for the source values by using one of the properties <a href=\"#http://purl.org/rvl/orderSourceValuesBy\">orderSourceValuesBy</a> resp. <a href=\"#http://purl.org/rvl/quantifySourceValuesBy\">quantifySourceValuesBy</a>. Analogeos properties exist to order/quantify the target values.

<h3>Calculation of value mappings / Semantics</h3>
The figure below gives an overview on the possible combinations between the Scale of measurement (SoM) of source and target values as well as on additional settings that can influence the mapping process. Note that although we allow for selecting continuous source ranges in VM, the RDF resources will always have concrete discrete values!

<h4>PSEUDOCODE:</h4>

<img src=\"http://www-st.inf.tu-dresden.de/semvis/ontologies/rvl/img/source_target_vm_combinations_by_som_pseudo_code.png\"/>

<h3>\"Constant values\"</h3>
VM will map any source value to a fixed target value, when no source values are defined (this implicitly means all values are selected) and only 1 target graphic attribute is defined. This can be used to show that there exists a value for this property at all, e.g. by using a specific color or adding some specific label when the property ist set.


<h3>Overlapping of value mappings:</h3>
When a source value is mapped by multiple VMs, the priority of the VMs is used to determine the mapping to be applied and a warning is issued. When two value mappings have the same priority, the one that is first mentioned is used and a warning should be issued. Already mapped values are then ignored when evaluating further VMs. The following priorities exist (1 = highest priority):

<ol>
<li>single value via ..value</li>
<li>..orderedSet/..List</li>
<li>set formed by multiple values via ..value</li>
<li>..Set</li>
<li>..interval</li>

              """CLARIFIED: Should value mappings also be able to work on the subject/predicate part of a statement? By setting \"object\" as default and using an optional parameter, this could be achieved. However, creating a different mapping for each subject value is hardly useful and different predicates can be distinguished via multiple property mappings or by mapping the URI to an additional visual means within a composite mapping. 

INFO: VMs for GO2ORs? - more arguments against:
For graphic object-to-object relations, we decided not to allow value mappings for the following reasons:
1 ) The behavior can be achieved by filtering on PM level as well
2) VM are convenience constructs for filtering statements by object only, but in the case of GO2ORs filtering the subject side is usually equally important. Object side as default makes no sense here.
3) There is no variety of \"values\" that needs to be distinguished (also stated in the comment above). Limiting a PM by attached VMs (which say relate or relate not, e.g. linked_to and not_linked_to) would contradict the PM's general statement. (-> filters are more logical)
4) The name \"VM\" would make no sense

TODO: Continuous Color Ranges:
Ranges of colors are complicated to describe, since color is a multidimensional construct and may be based on various color models (RGB, HSL, ..). Also it has to be possible to map to \"paths\" visiting multiple colors (e.g. from red via white to green). This has to be handled in future by extra mappings and could internally use discrete 1-to-1 value mappings (or an extra class \"PathStep\") to model the steps in such a path. The problem of color paths could be generalized to paths through other spaces than the color space as well. SVG also modells such paths and could be reused/immitated here.

TODO: Should this be abstract as in the diagram?

INFO: Using multiple Selectors at the same time:
At the moment using multiple selectors is only allowed for those selectors selecting unordered sets. Other considerations on this are noted in the figure below:

Using inheritedBy rdf:type, we can extend this setting to the instances as well (of course usually you will either hide classes at all or if both instances and classes shall be shown, you will need to distinguish them by another graphic attribute).  Besides inheriting via rdf:type and rdfs:subClassOf inheritance can be defined to happen via any rdf:Property, e.g. dc:partOf.

Mapping settings may also be extended to T-Box relationships using inheritedBy in combination with rvl:tBoxDomainRange, rvl:tBoxRestriction or a specific T-Box relation such as  \"owl:someValuesFrom\", \"owl:allValuesFrom\" or \"owl:hasValue\".

- WHAT ARE THE USE CASES FOR CONSTANT GRAPHIC OBJECTS?

     3) VRs where this is relevant: Labeling->Label, ProportionalRepetition->Copy, (others rarely)

- WHICH MODELLING APPROACHES DO WE HAVE?
     - Also use an n-ary Relation here and create a class SubGraphicRelation analogeous to SubMappingRelation?
     - Use AVM parts (this may cause difficulties in referencing super-mappings, when dynamic graphics (in sub-mappings) should later be created, since the AVM does not have to be a tree
