# RVL - Example Mappings #
 
A set of example mappings using the RDFS/OWL Visualization Language (RVL)

## Usage ##
 - Copy ogvic.properties.template to ogvic.properties (which is git-ignored) and set up your configuration there.
 - Run the JUnit tests in the examples package (org.purl.rvl.example)
 - After running the whole transformation process, a html file should be available in the  **/org.purl.rvl.tooling.d3vis** project
 - On errors, see the README in the rvl-interpreter package and make sure the required related projects are at the right place.
