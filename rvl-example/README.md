 - Copy ogvic.properties.template to ogvic.properties (which is git-ignored) and set up your configuration there.
 - Run the JUnit tests in the examples package (org.purl.rvl.example)
 - After running the transformation process, an HTML file should be generated and stored in the **/gen/html/** folder
 - On errors, see the README in the rvl-interpreter package and make sure the required dependencies are available
